										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The settlement is the largest ever for the Justice Department involving claims of discrimination based on citizenship<br />
REUTERSThe Apple Inc. logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, US,</p>
<p>Apple Inc will pay $25 million to settle claims by the US Department of Justice that the company illegally favoured immigrant workers over US citizen and green card holders for certain jobs, the agency said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Justice Department in a statement said Apple did not recruit US citizens or permanent residents for jobs that were eligible for a federal programme allowing employers to sponsor immigrant workers for green cards, in violation of a federal law that bars discrimination based on citizenship.</p>
<p>The settlement is the largest ever for the Justice Department involving claims of discrimination based on citizenship, the agency said. It requires Apple to pay $6.75 million in civil penalties and $18.25 million to an unspecified number of affected workers.</p>
<p>Apple in a statement said it had &#8220;unintentionally not been following the DOJ standard.&#8221;</p>
<p>“We have implemented a robust remediation plan to comply with the requirements of various government agencies as we continue to hire American workers and grow in the US.&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>According to the Justice Department, Apple did not advertise job openings that were eligible for the program, known as the permanent labour certification or PERM program, on its website as it routinely does for other positions. And the company required applicants for those jobs to mail paper applications even though it usually permits electronic applications, the department said.</p>
<p>&#8220;These less effective recruitment procedures nearly always resulted in few or no applications to PERM positions from applicants whose permission to work does not expire,&#8221; the department said.</p>
<p>The Justice Department did not specify which Apple jobs were affected by the recruitment procedures or how Apple may have benefited from them.</p>
<p>Foreign labour can often be cheaper than hiring US workers, and immigrants who rely on their employers for green card sponsorship are seen as less likely to leave for a different job.</p>
<p>Along with the payout, Apple agreed to align its recruiting for PERM jobs with its normal practices. The company will be required to conduct more expansive recruitment and train employees on anti-discrimination laws, according to the</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ratings agency changes its outlook from stable, citing large fiscal deficits and a decline in debt affordability<br />
A man is seen silhouetted wearing a protective face mask, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, walking near the financial district of New York City, US, October 18, 2021. REUTERSA man is seen silhouetted wearing a protective face mask, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, walking near the financial district of New York City, US,</p>
<p>Moody&#8217;s on Friday lowered its outlook on the US credit rating to &#8220;negative&#8221; from &#8220;stable&#8221; citing large fiscal deficits and a decline in debt affordability, a move that drew immediate criticism from President Joe Biden&#8217;s administration.</p>
<p>The move follows a rating downgrade of the sovereign by another ratings agency, Fitch, this year, which came after months of political brinkmanship around the US debt ceiling.</p>
<p>Federal spending and political polarisation have been a rising concern for investors, contributing to a selloff that took US government bond prices to their lowest levels in 16 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is hard to disagree with the rationale, with no reasonable expectation for fiscal consolidation any time soon,&#8221; said Christopher Hodge, chief economist for the U.S. at Natixis. &#8220;Deficits will remain large &#8230; and as interest costs take up a larger share of the budget, the debt burden will continue to grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ratings agency said in a statement that &#8220;continued political polarization&#8221; in Congress raises the risk that lawmakers will not be able to reach consensus on a fiscal plan to slow the decline in debt affordability.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any type of significant policy response that we might be able to see to this declining fiscal strength probably wouldn&#8217;t happen until 2025 because of the reality of the political calendar next year,&#8221; William Foster, a senior vice president at Moody&#8217;s, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Republicans, who control the US House of Representatives, expect to release a stopgap spending measure on Saturday aimed at averting a partial government shutdown by keeping federal agencies open when current funding expires next Friday.</p>
<p>Moody&#8217;s is the last of the three major rating agencies to maintain a top rating for the U.S. government. Fitch changed its rating from triple-A to AA+ in August, joining S&amp;P which has had an AA+ rating since 2011.</p>
<p>While it changed its outlook, indicating a downgrade is possible over the medium term, Moody&#8217;s affirmed its long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings at &#8216;Aha&#8217; citing U.S. credit and economic strengths.</p>
<p>Immediately after the Moody&#8217;s release, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said the change was &#8220;yet another consequence of congressional Republican extremism and dysfunction.&#8221;</p>
<p>“While the statement by Moody’s maintains the United States’ AAA rating, we disagree with the shift to a negative outlook. The American economy remains strong, and Treasury securities are the world’s preeminent safe and liquid asset,&#8221; Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in a statement.</p>
<p>Adeyemo said the Biden administration had demonstrated its commitment to fiscal sustainability, including through over $1 trillion in deficit reduction measures included in a June agreement struck with Congress on raising the US debt limit, and Biden’s proposal to reduce the deficit by nearly $2.5 trillion over the next decade.</p>
<p>Treasury yields have soared this year on expectations the Federal Reserve will keep monetary policy tight, as well as on US-focused fiscal concerns.</p>
<p>The sharp rise in Treasury yields &#8220;has increased pre-existing pressure on US debt affordability,&#8221; Moody&#8217;s said.</p>
<p>A Moody&#8217;s downgrade could exacerbate fiscal concerns, but investors have said they are skeptical it would have a material impact on the US bond market, seen as a safe haven because of its depth and liquidity.</p>
<p>However, “it is a reminder that the clock is ticking and the markets are moving closer and closer to understanding that we could go into another period of drama that could lead ultimately to the government shutting down,&#8221; said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial.</p>
<p>Moody&#8217;s decision also comes as Biden, who is seeking reelection in 2024, has seen his support fall sharply in the polls. A New York Times/Siena poll released on Sunday showed him trailing former President Donald Trump, the leading Republican candidate, in five of six battleground states: Nevada, Georgia, Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Biden was ahead of Trump in Wisconsin. The outcome in those six states will help determine who wins the presidential election.</p>
<p>The Moody&#8217;s move will also heap pressure on congressional Republicans to advance funding legislation to avert a partial government shutdown.</p>
<p>US House Speaker Mike Johnson has spent days in talks with members of his slim 221-212 Republican majority about several stopgap measures. The House and the Democratic-led Senate must agree on a vehicle that Biden can sign into law before current funding expires on Nov 17.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot, in good conscience, continue writing blank checks to our federal government knowing that our children and grandchildren will be responsible for the largest debt in American history,” hardline Republican Representative Andy Harris said on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>
<p>Infighting among House Republicans has led to flirtations with government shutdowns yet both parties have contributed to budget deficits.</p>
<p>Biden&#8217;s Democrats have backed a wide range of spending plans, while Republicans pushed through sharp tax cuts early in Donald Trump&#8217;s presidency that also fed the deficit. Neither party has seriously addressed rising costs of the Social Security and Medicare programs that represent a significant slice of federal spending.</p>

REUTERSAn illuminated Google logo is seen inside an office building in Zurich, Switzerland December 5, 2018.</p>
<p>Alphabet&#8217;s Google is in talks to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in Character.AI, as the fast growing artificial intelligence chatbot startup seeks capital to train models and keep up with user demand, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.</p>
<p>The investment, which could be structured as convertible notes, according to a third source, will deepen the existing partnership Character.AI already has with Google, in which it uses Google&#8217;s cloud services and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to train models.</p>
<p>Google and Character AI did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Founded by former Google employees Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, Character.AI allows people to chat with virtual versions of celebrities like Billie Eilish or anime characters, while creating their own chatbots and AI assistants. It is free to use, but offers subscription model that charges $9.99 a month for users who want to skip the virtual line to access a chatbot.</p>
<p>Character.AI&#8217;s chatbots, with various roles and tones to choose from, have appealed to users ages 18 to 24, who contributed about 60% of its website traffic, according to data from Similarweb. The demographic is helping the company position itself as the purveyor of more fun personal AI companions, compared to other AI chatbots from OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT and Google&#8217;s Bard.</p>
<p>The company previously said its website had attracted 100 million monthly visits in the first six months since its launch.</p>
<p>Character.AI is also in talks to raise equity funding from venture capital investors, which could value the company at over $5 billion, sources said. In March, it raised $150 million in a funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz at $1 billion valuation.</p>
<p>The talks with Google are ongoing and terms of the deal could change, said the sources, who requested anonymity as the discussions are private.</p>
<p>Google has been investing in AI startups, including $2 billion for model maker Anthropic in the form of convertible notes, on top of its earlier equity investment. Anthropic uses Google&#8217;s cloud services as well as its latest version of TPUs.</p>
<p>That is part of a recent trend in which big tech cloud services providers are striking deals with AI companies to entice them to use certain cloud or hardware in the computer-intensive race to build models and serve consumers, including Microsoft investments in OpenAI and Google and Amazon&#8217;s bets on Anthropic.</p>
<p>US Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan said at an event in San Francisco last week that the agency is looking into cloud provider investments in AI startups to examine any anti-competitive behaviours.</p>

REUTERSThe logo of Amazon is seen at the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris, France, Jun 15, 2023.<br />
Amazon.com has begun cutting jobs in its Music division, the company said on Wednesday, confirming the latest of several rounds of layoffs over the past year that have affected more than 27,000 employees of the retail giant.</p>
<p>Employees in Latin America, North America and Europe received notices that their jobs had been eliminated Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the layoff after being contacted by Reuters. She declined to say how many employees were impacted.</p>
<p>“We have been closely monitoring our organisational needs and prioritising what matters most to customers and the long-term health of our businesses,” she said in a statement. “Some roles have been eliminated on the Amazon Music team. We will continue to invest in Amazon Music.”</p>
<p>No mass layoff filings had recently been made in Washington state, where Amazon is based, California or New York, among the largest employee centers for the company, according to a review of Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification sites.</p>
<p>The cuts come even as Amazon reported third-quarter net income that far exceeded analyst estimates and forecast revenue in the year’s final quarter roughly in line with expectations. The fourth quarter is Amazon’s most crucial, as it in includes holiday shopping.</p>
<p>Amazon has been quietly trimming jobs, including communications staff in its Studios, Video and Music divisions last month.</p>
<p>Amazon Music, which also includes podcasts, competes with Spotify , Pandora, Alphabet’s Google and Apple in offering unlimited music streaming services for a fee. It raised the monthly subscription price earlier this year by a dollar to $10.99.</p>
