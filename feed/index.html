										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The deal to create a &#8220;loss and damage&#8221; fund was hailed as a breakthrough for developing country negotiators at United Nations climate talks in Egypt last year, overcoming years of resistance from wealthy nations.</p>
<p>But in the past 11 months, governments have struggled to reach consensus on the details of the fund, such as who will pay and where the fund will be located.</p>
<p>A special UN committee tasked with implementing the fund met for a fifth time in Abu Dhabi this week &#8211; following a deadlock in Egypt last month &#8211; to finalise recommendations that will be put to governments when they meet for the annual climate summit COP28 in Dubai in less than four weeks&#8217; time. The goal is to get the fund up and running by 2024.</p>

<p>The committee, representing a geographically diverse group of countries, resolved to recommend the World Bank serve as trustee and host of the fund &#8211; a tension point that has fuelled divisions between developed and developing nations.</p>
<p>Housing a fund at the World Bank, whose presidents are appointed by the US, would give donor countries outsized influence over the fund and result in high fees for recipient countries, developing countries have argued.</p>
<p>To get all countries on board, it was agreed the World Bank would serve as interim trustee and host of the fund for a four-year period.</p>
<p>Jennifer Morgan, Germany&#8217;s special climate envoy, said in a post on X that Berlin &#8220;stands ready to fulfil its responsibility &#8211; we&#8217;re actively working towards contributing to the new fund and assessing options for more structural sources of financing&#8221;.</p>
<p>Others were less optimistic.</p>
<p>“It is a sombre day for climate justice, as rich countries turn their backs on vulnerable communities,&#8221; said Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at nonprofit Climate Action Network International.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rich countries &#8230; have not only coerced developing nations into accepting the World Bank as the host of the Loss and Damage Fund but have also evaded their duty to lead in providing financial assistance to those communities and countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>The committee also recommended that developed countries be urged to continue to provide support to the fund, but failed to resolve whether wealthy nations would be under strict financial obligation to do chip in.</p>
<p>&#8220;We regret that the text does not reflect consensus concerning the need for clarity on the voluntary nature of contributions,&#8221; a US State Department official told Reuters.</p>
<p>The US attempted to include a footnote clarifying that any contributions to the fund would be voluntary, but the committee chair did not allow it. The US objected to that denial.</p>
<p>Sultan al-Jaber, who will preside over the COP28 talks, said he welcomed the committee&#8217;s recommendations and that they would pave the way for an agreement at COP28.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh has raised the minimum monthly wage for garment workers by 56.25 percent to Tk 12,500. The new wage will take effect from Dec 1.</p>
<p>The new wage structure was discussed at a meeting at the Ministry of Labour and Employment on Tuesday before the announcement was made by State Minister Monnujan Sufian.</p>
<p>Garment worker protests had engulfed Dhaka and Gazipur for several days, with two buses torched and several vehicles vandalised on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A closed-door meeting was held between representatives of factory owners and workers at the state minister’s office in the Secretariat prior to the press conference.</p>
<p>The new minimum wage has been set in line with the recommendations of the wage board and after consultations with representatives from both labour and employer groups, State Minister Sufian said.</p>
<p>Workers have been agitating for a long time for a pay hike, she noted.</p>
<p>“We ask the owners to reopen factories and we ask workers to return to work. The 5 percent increment remains in place.”</p>
<p>Five years ago, in December 2018, the government set the wage structure for garment workers. Accordingly, the new wage structure was to be declared by Nov 30.</p>
<p>The government formed the Minimum Wage Board in April to scrutinise the proposals for the new wages.</p>
<p>Labour representatives submitted a proposal for a minimum wage of Tk 20,393 at the wage board’s meeting on Oct 22. The owners countered with a minimum wage offer of Tk 10,400.</p>
<p>Garment workers took to the streets in Gazipur on Oct 23 after a rumour spread that the new minimum wage had been set at Tk 10,400.</p>
<p>The protests then spread to Ashulia, Savar, and Dhaka’s Mirpur. Protesters engaged in vandalism and clashed with the police. Owners closed down 500 factories in stages to try and control the situation.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, protesting workers in Gazipur torched two buses and vandalised several vehicles. However, there were no casualties.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh gross foreign currency reserves have fallen to around $19.5 billion after the payment of $1.21 billion import bills for September and October through the Asian Clearing Union.</p>
<p>Bangladesh Bank spokesman Mezbaul Haque said on Wednesday that the payments were adjusted in the central bank’s account with the New York Federal Reserve on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The payment for the September-October period was lower than $1.31 billion paid for July and August.</p>
<p>Economists say Bangladesh’s net reserves, which do not include dues to the International Monetary Fund and other liabilities, are around $17 billion.</p>
<p>The reserves fell below $30 billion for the first time in seven years when Bangladesh paid the import bills of July and August.</p>
<p>Bigger import bills than exports and inward remittances combined are mounting pressure on the country’s economy, ballooning the Balance of Payments.</p>
<p>To cut the deficit, Bangladesh signed a $4.7 billion loan deal with the IMF in January. The second instalment of the loan is expected to be cleared in December</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian fuel producers have been told by the government to prepare for the scrapping of all remaining restrictions on the export of diesel and gasoline, three industry sources told Reuters on Thursday.</p>
<p>Russia, the world&#8217;s top seaborne exporter of diesel, introduced a ban on fuel exports on Sept 21 to tackle high domestic prices and shortages.</p>
<p>The government eased restrictions on Oct 6, allowing the export of diesel by pipeline, but kept measures on gasoline exports in place. Overseas supplies of gasoline by trucks and railways are also prohibited.</p>
<p>Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov on Wednesday said that Russia was considering lifting the export ban on some grades of gasoline.</p>
<p>&#8220;They told the producers that exports will be opened up from next week,&#8221; said a Russian oil company source who spoke on condition of anonymity owing to the sensitivity of such decisions.</p>
<p>Another industry source said the ban would be lifted next week.</p>
<p>&#8220;They promised to lift the exports ban next week. In regards to this promise, we have formed an export schedule and a plan for refining,&#8221; said the source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The Russian energy ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Diesel is Russia&#8217;s biggest oil product export, at about 35 million metric tons last year. Almost three quarters of that was transported via pipeline. Russia also exported 4.8 million tons of gasoline in 2022.</p>
<p>Another company source said that a gasoline glut had emerged because of the restrictions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a low season now; we can&#8217;t sell so much on the domestic market,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Officials have said the ban would be lifted once the domestic market stabilises. Analysts had expected the restrictions to be scrapped after completion of the recent grain harvesting season.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak on Sunday said that Russia would continue an additional voluntary supply cut of 300,000 barrels per day from its crude oil and petroleum product exports until the end of December, as previously announced.</p>

<p>China&#8217;s consumer prices swung back into contraction and factory-gate deflation persisted in October as domestic demand struggled, weighing on the outlook for any broader-based recovery in the world&#8217;s second-largest economy.</p>
<p>The consumer price index (CPI) dropped 0.2% in October from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Thursday, a faster decline than the 0.1% fall expected in a Reuters poll.</p>
<p>The headline figure was dragged by a further slump in pork prices, down 30.1%, speeding up from a 22% slide in September, amid an oversupply of pigs and weak demand.</p>
<p>However, even core inflation, which excludes food and fuel prices, slowed to 0.6% in October from 0.8% in September, pointing to China&#8217;s continued battle with disinflationary forces and the risk of again missing the government&#8217;s full-year headline inflation target, set at around 3%.</p>
<p>Consumer prices slipped into deflation in July and returned to positive territory in August but were flat in September. Factory deflation persisted for the 13th straight month in October.</p>
<p>Combined with other economic indicators, the data in the fourth-quarter so far suggests a meaningful economic recovery remains elusive.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="j5Yri bQwHU">
<div class="story-element story-element-text">
<div>
<p>&#8220;The data shows combating persistent disinflation amid weak demand remains a challenge for Chinese policymakers,&#8221; said Bruce Pang, chief economist at Jones Lang Lasalle.</p>
<p>&#8220;An appropriate policy mix and more supportive measures are needed to prevent the economy from a downward drift in inflation expectations that could threaten business confidence and household spending.&#8221;</p>
<p>Month-on-month, CPI fell 0.1%, compared with a 0.2% gain in September.</p>
<p>The producer price index (PPI) fell 2.6% year-on-year against a 2.5% drop in September. Economists had predicted a 2.7% fall in October.</p>
<p>Authorities have repeatedly downplayed the risks.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no deflation in China and there will be no deflation in the future,&#8221; said a statistics bureau official in August.</p>
<p>Beijing has been ramping up measures to support the broader economy, including 1 trillion yuan ($137.43 billion) in sovereign bond issuance and a move to allow local governments to frontload part of their 2024 bond quotas.</p>
<p>But a property crisis, local debt risks and policy divergence with the West all complicate the recovery process.</p>
<p>Recent indicators of the economy have been mixed.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s imports unexpectedly grew in October while exports contracted at a quicker pace. Meanwhile, the official purchasing managers&#8217; index showed factory activity unexpectedly contracting and services activity slowing last month.</p>
<p>China also recorded its first-ever quarterly deficit in foreign direct investment (FDI), underlining capital outflow pressure following Western governments&#8217; &#8220;de-risking&#8221; moves.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect China&#8217;s economy to grow by 5.0% in 2023, in accordance with the target set by authorities, followed by 4.0% growth in 2024 and 2025,&#8221; said Moody&#8217;s on Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, we see downside risks to China&#8217;s trend growth on account of structural factors.&#8221;</p>
