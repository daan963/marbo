Factory deflation persisted for the 13th straight month in October.<\/p>\n<p>Combined with other economic indicators, the data in the fourth-quarter so far suggests a meaningful economic recovery remains elusive.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"j5Yri bQwHU\">\n<div class=\"story-element story-element-text\">\n<div>\n<p>&#8220;The data shows combating persistent disinflation amid weak demand remains a challenge for Chinese policymakers,&#8221; said Bruce Pang, chief economist at Jones Lang Lasalle.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;An appropriate policy mix and more supportive measures are needed to prevent the economy from a downward drift in inflation expectations that could threaten business confidence and household spending.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Month-on-month, CPI fell 0.1%, compared with a 0.2% gain in September.<\/p>\n<p>The producer price index (PPI) fell 2.6% year-on-year against a 2.5% drop in September. Economists had predicted a 2.7% fall in October.<\/p>\n<p>Authorities have repeatedly downplayed the risks.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There is no deflation in China and there will be no deflation in the future,&#8221; said a statistics bureau official in August.<\/p>\n<p>Beijing has been ramping up measures to support the broader economy, including 1 trillion yuan ($137.43 billion) in sovereign bond issuance and a move to allow local governments to frontload part of their 2024 bond quotas.<\/p>\n<p>But a property crisis, local debt risks and policy divergence with the West all complicate the recovery process.<\/p>\n<p>Recent indicators of the economy have been mixed.<\/p>\n<p>China&#8217;s imports unexpectedly grew in October while exports contracted at a quicker pace. Meanwhile, the official purchasing managers&#8217; index showed factory activity unexpectedly contracting and services activity slowing last month.<\/p>\n<p>China also recorded its first-ever quarterly deficit in foreign direct investment (FDI), underlining capital outflow pressure following Western governments&#8217; &#8220;de-risking&#8221; moves.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We expect China&#8217;s economy to grow by 5.0% in 2023, in accordance with the target set by authorities, followed by 4.0% growth in 2024 and 2025,&#8221; said Moody&#8217;s on Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;However, we see downside risks to China&#8217;s trend growth on account of structural factors.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>China&#8217;s consumer prices swung back into contraction and factory-gate deflation persisted in October as domestic demand struggled, weighing on the outlook for any broader-based recovery in the world&#8217;s second-largest economy.
